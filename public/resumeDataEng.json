    "bio": "Structural /mechanical engineer turned web developer, I have always loved building things, whether they are physical or not. I believe that a lot of what I have learned in my past career can translate to web development. I used to work on several scenic and artistic international projects requiring unusual creativity. Adaptability and responsiveness were essential in my position, and the atypical projects I have worked on required an openness to other disciplines and pushed me to develop my ability to learn autonomously and find solutions to problems. As I used to work with 3D modeling software with designers, I like receiving direct visual feedback of what I build, and that is the reason why I particularly enjoy front end development.",
